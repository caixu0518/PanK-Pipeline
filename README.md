# PanK-Pipeline: A Pan-genome _K_-mer Pipeline for Population Analysis

## Installation
The pipeline [PanK-Pipeline](https://github.com/caixu0518/PanK-Pipeline) is installation-free but requires dependencies: 

1. [jellyfish](https://github.com/gmarcais/Jellyfish). In the present pipeline,[jellyfish](https://github.com/gmarcais/Jellyfish) is mainly used to quickly generate _k_-mers from resequencing reads and perform _k_-mer query.
2. [plink](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink2/) (v1.90b6.21). [plink](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink2/) is mainly used when performing population structure analysis with _k_-mers.
